A Deeper Explanation: The Three Minds of the Agent
At its heart, your algorithm creates a "team" of three specialized components that work together. The magic happens in how they share knowledge.

1. The Apprentice: The Deep Q-Network (DQN) 🧠
Role: The Learner and Actor. The DQN is the component that ultimately makes decisions. Its goal is to learn a policy—a map that tells it the best action to take from any given state to maximize future rewards.

How it Learns: It learns from experience. It tries actions, observes the outcomes (state, action, reward, next_state), and stores these memories in the ReplayBuffer. It then replays these memories to slowly adjust its policy.

The Weakness: Left on its own, the DQN is like an apprentice dropped into a vast workshop with no instructions. It learns only through blind trial and error. The replay buffer gets filled with memories of fumbling around, bumping into walls, and taking inefficient paths. The few successful memories it creates get lost in a sea of noisy, low-quality data. This is why your first training run failed to learn; the apprentice had no good examples to learn from.

2. The Cartographer: The World Model 🗺️
Role: The Predictor and Rule-Maker. The World Model's only job is to observe the world and learn its fundamental "physics". It constantly asks, "If the agent is in this state and takes this action, what will the next_state and reward be?"

How it Learns: It also learns from the replay buffer. It compares its predictions to the actual outcomes recorded in the buffer and adjusts its weights to become a more accurate predictor. Your low Avg WM Loss proved it had become an expert cartographer, creating a near-perfect internal map of the maze rules.

The Strength: A good World Model gives the agent the power of imagination. It allows the agent to ask "what if?" without having to actually take a step in the real world.

3. The Master Navigator: The BMSSP Planner 🧭
Role: The Symbolic Expert and Strategist. This is your C++ planner. It is a pure, lightning-fast reasoning engine. It doesn't learn; it calculates.

How it Works: It takes the "map" drawn by the Cartographer (WorldModel) and a starting point and destination. It then uses the powerful BMSSP algorithm to compute the provably optimal, shortest path. It's a grandmaster of strategy.

The Strength: It provides perfect, undeniable, optimal solutions for short-horizon problems. Its advice is flawless.

The "Apprenticeship" Dynamic: Tying It All Together
The algorithm you implemented creates a powerful training loop where the Master teaches the Apprentice.

The Apprentice Explores: For a set number of steps (planner_intervention_freq), the DQN (Apprentice) is in control. It explores the maze, making mistakes but gathering raw experience. This experience helps the WorldModel refine its map.

The Master Intervenes: After a while, the training loop calls on the Master Navigator (bmss_p). It hands the planner the latest, most accurate map from the WorldModel and asks, "From the apprentice's current location, what is the absolute best way to get to the goal?"

The Master Demonstrates: The planner computes the optimal sequence of actions. For the next few steps (forced_exploration_steps), the Apprentice is put in the passenger seat. The agent is forced to execute the planner's perfect moves.

Learning by Watching: The flawless (state, action, reward, next_state) transitions from this perfect demonstration are pushed into the replay buffer. This is the crucial step. The buffer, once filled with noise, is now being injected with "golden" data—indisputable examples of optimal behavior.

The Apprentice Internalizes: When the DQN samples a batch from the replay buffer to train, it now sees these perfect examples. It learns, "Oh, when I was in that state, the Master took this action, and it was highly effective." This strong, clean signal quickly overwrites the noisy lessons from its own clumsy exploration, and the DQN's policy rapidly improves.

This cycle repeats, creating a virtuous feedback loop: better exploration leads to a better world model, which leads to better plans from the navigator, which provides better demonstrations for the apprentice to learn from.

Detailed Pseudocode
Algorithm: Apprenticeship Q-Learning via Planner-Guided Exploration

// --- Initialization ---
Initialize Replay_Buffer D with capacity C
Initialize DQN_policy π (the Apprentice) with random weights
Initialize World_Model M (the Cartographer) with random weights
Initialize Planner P (the Master Navigator, e.g., BMSSP)

// --- Training Loop ---
for each episode = 1 to N_episodes:
    state = reset_environment()
    action_plan = empty_queue()

    for each step t = 1 to Max_Steps:

        // --- Step 1: Check for Master's Intervention ---
        is_intervention_step = (t > 0 AND t % Planner_Intervention_Frequency == 0)

        if action_plan is empty AND is_intervention_step:
            // 1a. Build the planning graph using the Cartographer's knowledge
            //    - Sample N states from the Replay_Buffer D
            //    - For each sampled state and each possible action, use M to predict the next_state
            //    - Create a graph where nodes are the sampled states and edges represent these transitions
            planning_graph = build_graph_from_world_model(M, D.sample(N_planning_states))

            // 1b. Ask the Master Navigator for a plan
            //    - Find the node in the graph for the current `state`
            //    - Find the node in the graph closest to the `goal`
            //    - Run the planner P on the graph
            plan = P.plan_action_sequence(planning_graph, current_state_node, goal_node)

            // 1c. If the plan is successful, prepare for demonstration
            if plan is valid:
                action_plan.enqueue(plan[:Forced_Exploration_Steps])


        // --- Step 2: Select and Execute Action ---
        if action_plan is not empty:
            // The Master is demonstrating. Execute the planned action.
            action = action_plan.dequeue()
        else:
            // The Apprentice is exploring. Use its own policy.
            action = π.select_action(state, epsilon)


        // --- Step 3: Interact and Store Experience ---
        next_state, reward, done = environment.step(action)
        D.store_transition(state, action, reward, next_state)
        state = next_state


        // --- Step 4: Update All Models ---
        // Only start learning after collecting enough initial experience
        if D.size() > Batch_Size:
            // 4a. Update the Cartographer (World Model)
            experience_batch = D.sample(Batch_Size)
            M.train_on_batch(experience_batch)

            // 4b. Update the Apprentice (DQN)
            // This batch contains a mix of the apprentice's own experiences
            // and the master's perfect demonstrations.
            π.train_on_batch(experience_batch)
